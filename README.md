# InstaFollower
Tool for getting Instagram: Followers - Non-Followers and Unfollowers

Before you start using InstaFollower you need to install the requirements.txt.
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Install chromedriver
- If the first did not work install it by typing: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

To start InstaFollower run main.py -u "username" -p "yourpassword"

Alternatively you can type in the password in files/login - so everytime you start the program you need to pass your username an argument.
